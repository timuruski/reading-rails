Reading Rails is a sort of blog about Ruby on Rails.  It is not about
how to build things using Rails.  Instead it is about of how Rails
*itself* is built.  The articles posted here will explore both the
implementation details and the history of the project.

In the spirit of Rails and getting started quickly, this blog will
initially be hosted via GitHub.  When enough content has been produced
it may find a more permanent home.  Maybe the project will fizzle out
entirely.  It's too early to tell.

My own aim is to better understand Rails and how it influenced the Ruby
community, while also critically looking at what makes Rails the way it
is.  With any luck you will find my endeavours entertaining and maybe
enlightening.
