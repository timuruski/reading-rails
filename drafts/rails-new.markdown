I should open this blog with my credentials.  I have none.  I'm not part
of the Rails core team.  I haven't made any contributions to Rails.
I've only worked on one profitable Rails project.  I regularly use other
frameworks for side projects.  Worst of all, I don't even like Rails
that much!

Then why the hell am I starting a blog about Rails?  For starters, it's
a deep, open source project covering a lot of ground and full of
solutions to real world problems, so there's a lot to write about.
Also, despite my distaste for some of ways Rails works, it's been worked
on by some very bright people, there's a lot to learn from them.

Lastly, by digging deep into the source of Rails, I'm sure I'll find
some things worth fixing and may even make some contributions.  My goals
are as much my own education as sharing with the community.  Some topics
I expect to write about:

* Following a specific thread of execution through the various layers of
  the Rails stack.
* Digging deep into the design and implementation of a single layer,
  especially some of the more controversial metaprogramming techniques.
* History of a feature, what's changed and why.
* Outstanding issues and how to work around them if possible.
