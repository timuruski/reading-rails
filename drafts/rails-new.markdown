I should probably start with my experience as a Ruby developer and how I
came to use Rails, since it will influence a lot of the initial posts
here.  

Like many Ruby developers, my earliest encounter with the language was
via Rails.  I did install Ruby a year before Rails was announced as part
of a scripting language tutorial.  I wasn't very familiar with the
command line or automating my workflow, so I didn't get much out of it.
tutorial.  My day job involved building Flash websites (yes, I was was
one of those developers), so Rails was a lot more relevant to me when it
was announced.  (Back then I was fairly enthusiastic about 37signals.)

I bought a copy of the Pragmatic Programmers book about Rails when it
came out and started reading.  I quickly stopped.  I was uncomfortable
with the blurry line between Rails and Ruby.  I had a similar issue a
few years later with jQuery and Javascript.  Learning the underlying
language was my first priority, so I stepped away from Rails and
focussed instead on learning plain Ruby.

I mostly wrote some small scripts to generate files from ERB templates
and later worked on a relatively large codebase using Sinatra.
